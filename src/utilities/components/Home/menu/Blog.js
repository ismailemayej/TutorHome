      </h5>

          <b className="text-semibold">Authorization</b> is the process of
          granting or denying access to a resource or system based on the
          privileges and permissions assigned to an individual or entity. It
          ensures that only authorized users can access specific information,
          perform certain actions, or use particular resources within a system.
          In the context of computer systems and networks, authorization is a
          crucial aspect of security measures. It typically follows the
          authentication process, where a user verifies their identity using
          credentials such as a username and password. Once the user's identity
          is established, authorization determines what actions they are allowed
          to perform and what resources they can access based on their assigned
          privileges. Authorization mechanisms often involve the use of access
          control lists (ACLs) or permissions that define the specific rights
          and privileges associated with different user roles or groups. These
          permissions can include read, write, modify, delete, execute, or other
          predefined actions on files, folders, databases, or system settings.
          Authorization helps enforce security policies, protect sensitive data,
          maintain system integrity, and prevent unauthorized access or
          malicious activities. It ensures that individuals or entities only
          have access to the resources and information that are necessary for
          their roles and responsibilities, thereby reducing the risk of
          unauthorized use or abuse of system resources.

          <b>Authentication</b> is the process of verifying the identity of an
          individual or entity to ensure that they are who they claim to be. It
          is commonly used in computer systems and networks to grant access to
          authorized users and protect sensitive information from unauthorized
          access. During authentication, a user typically provides credentials
          such as a username and password, which are then compared to a stored
          database of user credentials. If the provided credentials match the
          stored information, the user is considered authenticated, and access
          is granted to the system or resource. Various authentication methods
          exist, including:
